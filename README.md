# MagicGardens-HTB
This report details the exploitation of the MagicGardens machine, starting with an XSS attack to steal admin cookies, gaining access to the Django admin panel, exploiting a buffer overflow, accessing the Docker Registry, and leveraging a deserialization vulnerability. Finally, privilege escalation via a kernel module grants full system control.
